DTG | Issue | Remediation | Fix Action  
---|---|---|---  
2026-01-13 16:30 PST | An agent created on one node was not able to see any other agents on the network. | After reviewing the default CLI inputs and main.rs, it was identified that the CLI defaulted to the local file adapter which would not store any data in regard to other agents on the network. | Implemented a selectable storage adapter and added CLI flags to configure the backend. The new CLI flags (`--adapter`, `--file-path`, `--dht-host`, `--dht-port`) allow a node to explicitly point to the OpenDHT REST adapter to share group state.
2026-01-13 17:45 PST | `docker compose up` failed with `Resource deadlock avoided (os error 35)` during `cargo build` in the builder container. | Checked the compose configuration and identified that Cargo was building into a bind-mounted volume. | Set `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` to a container-local path to keep build artifacts off the bind mount.
2026-01-13 18:15 PST | Pi reported `Exec format error` when running the `mysgm` binary. | Verified the binary architecture and compared it to the Pi architecture. Determined the binary was built for a different target. | Rebuilt the binary for the Pi target (`aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`) and deployed the correct artifact from `target/aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu/release/`. Added the `mysgm_builder` service in `Dockerfile.builder` to build the binary for the Pi architecture
2026-01-14 15:30 PST | REST proxy returned 502 on `POST /key/...` during `advertise` | Verified REST proxy reachable with `curl`, inspected Docker logs, confirmed PUTs intermittently succeeded despite 502 | Treated temporary PUT errors as success when the key was observable afterward and ensured JSON content-type on REST POSTs  
2026-02-15 16:45 PST | `group add agent_XXX` failed with “unexpected argument” | Reviewed CLI definitions and `clap` usage; validated stdin-only workflow | Added CLI args for `Group Add`/`Group Remove` with stdin fallback--!>
2026-01-16 17:00 PST | Nodes can see peers on network, but unable to see group created by controller.| Checked REST API `curl -v 172.25.0.154:8000/key/wm0`, received empty JSON. The Welcome was never stored in wm0. Attempted to remove member and then re-add them to check logs and see if Welcome message was ever stored. Found that wm5 was the first index to store Welcome. | UNRESOLVED
